## Details

For the Global Game Jam 2022, we created a game on the theme of duality, in which you play the role of a young man in prison who has the ability to transpose his mind into a large rat.

Thanks to this ability, he will be able to escape.

The game is based on a series of brainteasers requiring you to switch from one protagonist to another continually in order to solve them.

## Role

We were a team of 3 developers and 3 artists.

I was mainly in charge of organizing the team and leading the brainstorming sessions, as well as looking after the design part of the puzzles and organizing the game scenario.

I also helped some of my colleagues when they had difficulties.
