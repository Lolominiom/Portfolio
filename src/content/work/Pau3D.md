## Details

It's an augmented reality application, where you scan a marker such as an image, QRCode, or even an element of the city (guardrail, floor, mechanical element).
The result is a 3D environment superimposed on reality, displaying additional information such as a description of a mountain peak, the story of a Tour de France runner, etc.

## Events

For events such as Halloween, Easter and Christmas. I created a 3D environment of a village type space allowing users to play like an egg hunt and then win a prize at a stand related to the event in progress.

## Roles

As the application is already up and running, I'm mainly in charge of level design for the creation of 3D environments, as well as adding occasional scripts when necessary and updating versions.
