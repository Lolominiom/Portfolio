## Details

For the ANATEN Jam, an in-school game jam, we created a Halloween-themed game.

We played as a monster who hunts children who spoil liquorice sweets (which children don't really like), but the monster fears the light.

We find ourselves in a house with 4 hidden children to find in a given time, we can move the furniture, open the doors and eat the spoiled candy to save time.

## Role

For the project we were a team of 2 developers and 4 artists.

My role was mainly to manage the requests made to the artists and to be the level designer.

I created the house on Blender and then integrated it into Unity, as well as creating the decorations using the artists' props.

As well as producing the timer and HUD.
